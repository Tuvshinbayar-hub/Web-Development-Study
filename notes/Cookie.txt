A Cookie is small amount of information saved by the browser. Usually used to save information of personal preference, info of cards or for tracking info.
Express does not have cookie-parser by default. So 'cookie-parser' api should be installed seperately.
We can find cookies for that side by checking application tab in inspection window.

They're 2 types of cookies.
1. unsigned cookie = anyone can change it after being set.
2. signed cookie = keeps track of not being changed.If the cookie's been changed it also notifies it.


const express = require('express');
const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser'); 				- as express does not have cookie-parse by default. We've to install it.

const app = express();

app.use(cookieParser('jojo123'));					- it's for setting up secret password for signing. Everyone with that key can change the signed cookie.

app.get('/setCookie', (req, res) => {					- cookie has key and value to save.
    res.cookie('foo1', 'foo2');
    res.send('cookie has been set');
})

app.get('/setsignedcookie', (req, res) => {				
    res.cookie('signedFoo1', 'singed foo Value', { signed: true });	- {signed: true} marks the cookie as signed.
    res.send('signed cookie has been set');
})

app.get('/getsignedcookie', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.signedCookies);					- {req.signedCookies} - gets the all signedCookies
    console.log(req.cookies);						- {req.cookies} - gets all unsigned cookies

    res.send(req.signedCookies);
})
