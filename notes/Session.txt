A session is a method of saving a small amount of data in RAM, which can be stored on disk with proper persistence 
mechanisms and later sent to the client as a cookie for data retrieval.

const session = require('express-session');
const sessionPreferences = {secret: 'jojomojo123', resave: false, saveUninitialized: false};

app.use(session(sessionPreferences));
