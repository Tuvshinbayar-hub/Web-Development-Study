A session is a method of saving a small amount of data in RAM, which can be stored on disk with proper persistence 
mechanisms and later sent to the client as a cookie for data retrieval.

const session = require('express-session');
const sessionConfig = {
    secret: 'Mojijojo123',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
      httpOnly: true,			- is for extra security
      expires: Date.now() + 1000 * 3600 * 24 * 7,	- setting up expire date
      maxAge: 1000 * 3600 * 24 * 7
    }
  };

app.use(session(sessionPreferences));
